# 🌿 Tokenized Biodiversity Credits Marketplace

Welcome to an innovative Web3 solution for combating habitat loss! This project creates a decentralized marketplace on the Stacks blockchain where corporations can purchase tokenized biodiversity credits to offset their environmental impact. These credits are backed by verified conservation efforts, ensuring transparency, traceability, and real-world ecological benefits through blockchain technology.

## ✨ Features
🌍 Tokenize verified conservation projects as biodiversity credits  
💼 Corporate offsetting: Buy and retire credits to meet sustainability goals  
🔍 On-chain verification of habitat restoration efforts  
📈 Marketplace for trading credits between users and projects  
🏆 Governance for community-driven project approvals  
🔒 Secure escrow for transactions to prevent fraud  
📊 Trackable offsets with immutable records  
🚫 Anti-double-spending mechanisms for credit integrity  
🤝 Integration with oracles for real-world data feeds (e.g., satellite verification)  

## 🛠 How It Works
This project leverages 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to handle everything from credit creation to marketplace trading. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **BiodiversityCreditToken.clar**: An SIP-10 compliant fungible token contract for representing biodiversity credits. Handles minting, burning, and transfers.
2. **ConservationProjectRegistry.clar**: Registers new conservation projects with details like location, goals, and verification metrics. Ensures unique project IDs.
3. **VerificationOracle.clar**: Integrates with external oracles to confirm real-world conservation milestones (e.g., habitat restoration via satellite data).
4. **CreditMinter.clar**: Mints new credits only after oracle-verified project progress, linking tokens to actual ecological impact.
5. **Marketplace.clar**: Enables listing, buying, and selling of credits with automated matching and fees.
6. **Escrow.clar**: Holds funds and credits during trades to ensure secure, atomic swaps.
7. **OffsetTracker.clar**: Records corporate offsets by retiring credits, providing immutable proof for audits and reporting.
8. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Allows token holders to vote on project approvals, oracle integrations, and protocol upgrades.

**For Conservation Organizations**  
- Register your project via `register-project` with details like habitat type and restoration plan.  
- Submit verification data through the oracle.  
- Once verified, call `mint-credits` to generate tokens based on achieved milestones.  
- List credits on the marketplace for sale to corporations.  

**For Corporations**  
- Browse verified projects using `get-project-details`.  
- Purchase credits via `buy-credits` on the marketplace, with escrow ensuring safe delivery.  
- Retire credits by calling `retire-offset` to log your environmental offset on-chain.  
- Verify your compliance anytime with `get-offset-history`.  

**For Verifiers and Auditors**  
- Use `verify-project` to check oracle data and on-chain records.  
- Participate in governance votes to maintain system integrity.  

That's it! This system empowers corporations to offset habitat loss responsibly while incentivizing verified conservation, all powered by the secure and scalable Stacks blockchain. Get started by deploying the contracts and building your dApp frontend!
